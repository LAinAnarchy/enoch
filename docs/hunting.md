Rolling to Hunting
</div>
Hunting is a vital part of Vampire: the Masquerade. Unfortunately, because of the amount of players, Storytellers aren't able to narrate every single hunt that happens on the server. To keep things running smoothly players are able to construct a roll from tables below and hunt with relative autonomy.

<div class="secondHeader">
Process
</div>

* Choose a location
* Pick an <b>Attribute</b> and <b>Ability</b> to roll. They must logically work together to convey how your character is hunting.
* Decide if a discipline is being added. Recognize that there can be consequences depending on the power used.
* Calculate the difficulty
* Roll your pool of dice against the difficulty

<div class="yourAttentionPlease" style="margin-top: 20px;">

<b>Please inform the Storyteller or an Assistant before rolling if:</b>
* This is your first hunting roll on the server
* Your character is a fledgling and has never hunted before
* Your character is at or below their hunger threshold (7 - self control)
* You have already hunted the same evening and would like to roll again.
* You plan on taking more than 2 BP from a single vessel
</div>

<div class="secondHeader">
Backgrounds
</div>

Only the following backgrounds can be applied to hunting rolls:

* <b>Domain:</b> Reduces the difficulty of the roll by one per dot to a minimum of 3 as long as the character is hunting inside of their domain
* <b>Herd:</b> Adds one die to all pools per dot as long as they are attempting to feed from their herd specifically
* <b>Fame:</b> Reduces the difficulty of the roll by one per dot to a minimum of 3 as long as their fans would realistically be within the area they are hunting.

<div class="secondHeader">
Disciplines
</div>

While many disciplines can be used while hunting, we only allow abilities that can be activated without a dice roll.

When applying a discipline to a hunt, the power doesn’t lower the difficulty, but adds more dice to your pool so the likelihood of success is higher. The abilities currently able to be applied to hunting rolls are: Heightened Senses (Auspex), Unseen Presence (Obfuscate), Eyes of the Beast (Protean), The Eyes of the Serpent (Serpentis), and Flight.

When using disciplines:

* You must spend the required blood or willpower before making the hunting roll. These resources will not be refunded if the hunt fails.
* Serpentis will <b>always</b> result in a masquerade breach. Please contact the Storyteller or an Assistant before making your roll.

Botches
</div>

All dice rolls come with the inherent risk of failure, and hunting is no exception to that rule. If your roll comes up negative, the Storytellers will be alerted to resolve the hunt with you. It's important to note that botches will play off of the circumstances of the hunt taking place. Discipline use might warrant a masquerade breach, you could attract hunters to your domain, or the vessel might be killed.

<div class="yourAttentionPleaseWhite">

<b>Important</b>

A botch isn't a failure — it's considerably worse. Because the outcome of the scene is already dictated by this roll, there's no escape of these consequences.
