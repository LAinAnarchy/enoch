      Mature Content
      </div>
      While it is not a rule, we recommend that all players are 18+ due to mature subject matters such as (but not limited to): sexual violence, political extremism, physical violence and gore, mind control, torture, abuse, imprisonment and kidnapping, racism, sexism, and homophobia.

      <div class="secondHeader">
        Respect
      </div>
      Be polite and courteous to others. This includes avoiding generally hostile/aggressive behavior; abuse or harassment of other members; threats or derogatory statements; OOC calls to excessive violence towards other players; and prejudice or hate speech.

      Privacy
      </div>
      If you have something to say to someone, take it to DMs and leave it out of public channels. This includes but isn't limited to leaking DMs without permission, discussing moderation action in public channels, and so on.

    <div class="gridChild">
    <div class="secondHeader">
      Language
      </div>
    Using English primarily. This is an English-based server, so English is the primary language we all communicate in. Refrain from communicating in other languages outside of short phrases and thematic text in your RP posts.

        No Erotic Content
      </div>
      There is a zero tolerance policy for any ERP/Erotic Roleplay within the server. Whenever a scene begins to head in that direction, it must fade to black.

      Player Agency Protection

      Character Limit

      You are allowed to have as many characters as you can handle. Having more than one of your characters in the same scene is allowed, but using them to gain advantages (teaching yourself a Discipline, gaining a combat advantage, learning meta information) is not.

      Age
      </div>
      For each year spent as a vampire, a point of experience is awarded up until 100 years. A character is able to be a maximum of 500 years old with 100 bonus experience, although this extreme is not recommended. New players have restrictions found in the <a href='new-player-guide.md'>New Player Walkthrough</a>.

      Path of Enlightenment
      </div>
      In order to take a Path of Enlightenment, you must spend 3 freebies and write a paragraph justification as to how they were able to withstand converting and why they did so. This justification can be apart of your character's history.

    <div class="gridChild">
      <div class="thirdHeader">
      Sect Alignment
    </div>
      The only available sects are Camarilla, Anarch, and Independent. Sabbat-Aligned Lasombra, Tzimisce, and Tzimisce antitribu are banned. Tremere are assumed to be aligned with House Carna unless it is specified that they are loyal to House Tremere. Characters still aligning with the Sabbat regardless of this rule will be removed from play.
