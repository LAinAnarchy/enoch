  Getting Started
  </div>
  <div class="swatchHeader" style="color: #384b7e;">
  Human Concept
  </div>

No one starts undead. Consider the follow questions to form this character when they were human:
* Place of birth, where do they live today, where have they lived and why?
* Do they have living family? Are they close to them? Why?
* Are they religious? What religion? How religious? (mass on Sundays, pray every meal, tithe regularly and donate time, etc.)
* What is their place in the world from your character's point of view? Where would you like it to be?
* What little things are important to them?
* What weighs heavy on their soul? What sins have they committed, or if they don't believe in such things, why?
* What habits do they have? Not just smoking, drinking, but also do they read the paper every morning, have a routine, etc.?
* What matters to them?

<div class="swatchHeader" style="color: #384b7e;">
Archetype
</div>
People have two ways they present themselves. The first is how they act in public and how they’re commonly viewed on a shallow level. This is your character’s Demeanor. It has no mechanical effect, but it should be accurately portrayed in-play.

The other side to this is how the character acts behind closed doors, with those close to them, and when they believe no one is watching. This is your characters Nature. When a character acts towards their nature during play (such as a caregiver successful nurturing someone else) they will regain one willpower point at the discretion of the storyteller and assistants.

Your nature and your demeanor cannot be the same.

A full list of available archetypes and what they mean can be found <a href="archetypes.md">here</a>. Keep in mind that unless the character is older, they're still human in mindset while picking these out, so options like Monster as a Nature wouldn’t make sense unless they were an utterly awful human being.

<div style="line-height: 1.5">

* <b>Generation:</b> 8th-15th generations
* <b>Age:</b> Freshly embraced to 500 years old with torpor included
* <b>Bloodlines:</b> If you are interested in playing a bloodline please see the <a href="bloodlines.md">specific page</a> for more information.

</div>

<div class="yourAttentionPlease">

<b>So you want to play a 15th generation thinblood...</b>

The V20 flaw will still:
* Limit their blood pool to 6 useable out of 10
* Double blood point costs for using disciplines
* Render their vitae infertile for both childer and ghouls, and unable to form blood bonds
* Restrict all disciplines learned to 3 dots maximum

However, the following modifications have been made:
* Unable to have been embraced more than 10 years ago
* Unable to spend blood points to raise attributes or heal
* All difficulties to resist frenzy reduced by 2, unless something counteracts it (such as the Brujah clan weakness)
* All difficulties to resist the disciplines of other Kindred are increased by 2
  * Dominate attempts will always succeed
* All damage is taken and healed is as if they were mortal
  * IE: gunshots are lethal instead of bashing damage, a stake to the heart results in death instead of paralysis, sunlight is harmless
* Need to breathe, sleep, and consume food alongside vitae

Other details (such a whether or not they have fangs or are affected by daysleep) are left to the player's discretion.

</div>

  <!-- tabs:start -->

  #### ** Assamites **

  <div class="secondHeader">Assamites</div>
  <em>"Your blood is anathema to me, but the act of spilling it brings me closer to Haqim."</em>

  Business is booming for the assassins with tensions between sects remaining taught. Of course, those not looking to get caught in the crossfire are having a particularly difficult time keeping their heads down.

  * <b>Sect:</b> Independent
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Celerity, Obfuscate, Quietus
  * <b>Weakness:</b> One automatic level of unsoakable lethal damage per blood point imbibed from other kindred. Diablerie attempts result in automatic aggravated damage, one health level per point of permanent Willpower the victim possesses; the would-be diablerist gains no benefits (including Generation reduction) if they survive the process. In addition, Assamites must tithe some of the profits from their contracts to their sires or superiors (generally around 10 percent of all such earnings).
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b> The blood of Assamite ghouls carries the taint of the Clan’s many curses. Over a period of seven to ten years, their mortal blood begins to darken and eventually turns pitch black.

  #### ** Brujah **

  <div class="secondHeader">Brujah</div>
  <em>"I’ll give you a head start. You’re the tortoise and I’m the hare — a pissed-off, fuck-the-world hare with a score to settle and a thirst like the devil’s own."</em>

  It is no secret the Brujah have always strained against authority out of desire for a better vision of tomorrow. The clan is always moving forward, enacting change in the static world of the kindred as best they can. The divide in the Tower was the last push needed for the clan to fully remove themselves from the Camarilla. In a twist of irony, the majority of Camarilla Brujah returned to the fold of their Anarch brethren instead of the other way around. On the part of the Anarch Brujah, the reception of their estranged clanmates have been mixed, some welcoming them with open arms while others are slow to trust these new additions.

  <ul>
  * <b>Sect:</b> Anarch
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Celerity, Potence, Presence
  * <b>Weakness:</b> The difficulties of rolls to resist or guide frenzy are two higher than normal. Additionally, a Brujah may never spend Willpower to avoid frenzy, though they may spend a point of Willpower to end a frenzy that has already begun.
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b> Brujah ghouls are easily angered. Difficulties to avoid frenzy are two greater.
  </ul>

  #### ** Followers of Set **

  <div class="secondHeader">Followers of Set</div>
  <em>"I know what you need."</em>

The Followers of Set fractured after the Regression and aftermath. It caused the Setites to split into distinct groupings: The mainline clan, who has become dominated by the Cohort of Wepwawet - with Ancients awakening to reclaim their mantle as stewards of the clan until the return of their Antediluvian, and those who've became somewhat disillusioned from the Reversion.
‍

Two branches have formed among the Setites who had fled to the Camarilla previously under the guise of Caitiffs. Many of the Clan's youth flocked to the Caribbean to join the Serpents of the Light, while others such as the Mesu Bedshet have thrown their lot in with the rebels, due to their hatred of the Ventrue Clan, offering their services in exchange for a place within this Anarch revolution.

  * <b>Sect:</b> Independent
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Obfuscate, Presence, Serpentis
  * <b>Weakness:</b> Add two health levels to damage caused by exposure to sunlight. Setites also lose one die from dice pools for actions taken in bright light (police spotlights, stage lights, flares, etc.).
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b>  Ghouls who subsist primarily on Setite vitae gradually develop an aversion to daylight. During daylight hours, she might require strong, prescription sunglasses, and bright flashes such as a camera flash or lightning may require a Frenzy check. Among ghouls of certain Clans and bloodlines, like the Followers of Set, this Flaw can worsen over long periods of time at the Storyteller’s discretion.

  #### ** Gangrel **

  <div class="secondHeader">Gangrel</div>
  <em>"This is not a place for you, and it is too late to turn back. <b>Run</b>, little man."</em>

The Gangrel's time as one of the six pillars of the Camarilla ended as the edict spread out. The oldest amongst the clan within the Tower, frustrated with what they saw as another bid for greater power and control by Tremere, decided that their time in the Ivory Tower was over. They had been complacent when the Tower had silenced their skalds and lorekeepers, but this was the nail in the proverbial coffin. Those that held the respect of the clan left and took with them a large portion of their clanmates.

  * <b>Sect:</b> Anarch
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Animalism, Fortitude, Protean
  * <b>Weakness:</b> Every time a Gangrel frenzies, they acquire a temporary animal characteristic (which may replace an existing temporary one). Players should work with the Storyteller to determine what new animal trait is acquired (whether the frenzy involved the fight-or-flight impulse may be relevant). Over time, or in an exceptional situation, a particular animal feature may become permanent, with the next frenzy adding a new feature. A good guideline is to require each frenzy-gained trait to have some effect grounded in system terms (such as the temporary reduction of Social Attribute dots or a permanent loss of Humanity), though Storytellers may allow narrative-only traits that can shape the story
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b>  Gangrel ghouls, regardless of bloodline, are affected by the phases of the moon. Under the crescent moon, difficulties to avoid frenzy increase by one. Under the half or gibbous moon, difficulties rise by two.

  #### ** Giovanni **

  <div class="secondHeader">Giovanni</div>
  <em>"You misunderstand the situation if you think you’re important to me alive."</em>

The Giovanni were untouched by the news of the revolt, consolidated in their territories and respected in Venice, few would dare say that the Giovanni could be threatened. They continued to respect the treaty with the Camarilla and handled their internal affairs, but, troubling to many - the ruling Anziani council of Venice has called together the Dons of all the families for unknown purposes. Supposedly on the orders of Augustus Giovanni himself.

  * <b>Sect:</b> Independent
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Dominate, Necromancy, Potence
  * <b>Weakness:</b>  When a Giovanni feeds upon a mortal, she does twice as much damage as the Kiss of another vampire would inflict. For example, if a Giovanni takes one point of blood from a mortal vessel, that victim would suffer two health levels of damage.
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b> All Giovanni ghouls suffer from the Vengeance Flaw. This Flaw manifests whenever the player character discovers that a member of the extended Giovanni family, either herself or another mortal, ghoul, revenant, or vampire, has been wronged. The player will take on other vows of vengeance as if she herself had been hurt. This Flaw may be resisted for a day by spending a Willpower point.

  #### ** Malkavian **

  <div class="secondHeader">Malkavian</div>
  <em>"You misunderstand the situation if you think you’re important to me alive."</em>

The Seers found themselves divided as the Camarilla waned and crumbled around them despite being one of the lesser pillar clans. A majority of the Elders either remained with the Camarilla, or retreated to their havens to weather the incoming storm. The younger amongst the clan were bolstering the ranks of the Third Anarch Revolt.

  * <b>Sect:</b> Anarch (Younger), Camarilla (Older)
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Auspex, Dementation (OR Dominate), Obfuscate
  * <b>Weakness:</b> All members of Clan Malkavian suffer from a permanent, incurable derangement. They may acquire and recover from other derangements, and may spend Willpower to ameliorate the effects of the derangement for a scene, but they can never recover from their original derangement.
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b>  All malkavian ghouls acquire either the Nightmares or Phobia Flaw. The player chooses whichever Flaw most fits their character’s background. Eventually, should a Malkavian ghoul survive for at least a year, their Flaw changes into an incurable Derangement.

  #### ** Nosferatu **

  <div class="secondHeader">Nosferatu</div>
  <em>"Nobody down here but us boogeymen. Hey, whose head is this?"</em>

 The Nosferatu spend much of their time hidden from the eyes of most, keeping to the sewers and other such dark, forgotten places where few dare venture. With the Great Division within the Tower, the Nosferatu have, for the majority, pulled away as that edict had threatened many of the Sewer Rats. The bonds of Clan outweigh the ties of sect - as they say, blood is thicker than water. Those who haven't turned their backs on sects entirely have found the drama unfolding to be rather profitable, to say the least.

  <ul>
  * <b>Sect:</b> Anarch
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Animalism, Obfuscate, Potence
  * <b>Weakness:</b> All Nosferatu have an Appearance score of zero, and they may never improve it. Cross it off the character sheet. Dice pools that use the Appearance Trait are inherently difficult for these hideous Kindred.
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b> Nosferatu ghouls are often shocked to discover their appearance degrades over time, much like their domitors. Mechanically, the ghoul loses one to two points of Appearance over time, although their total Appearance may not drop below 1.
  </ul>

  #### ** Toreador **

  <div class="secondHeader">Toreador</div>
  <em>"Long after you die, I will still be young, beautiful, and adored by everyone whose life I touch."</em>

  The Roses of Los Angeles answer to a Methuselah of their kind, and for many of them, the Camarilla’s civil dispute affected them little. Melisande has put her roots down in Hollywood, and has developed a cult of personality among her lesser clanmates. She is protective of her domain and is willing to bring other roses into her garden. On an international level many of the Clan’s elders have chosen to remain within the Ivory Tower, albeit reluctantly, while the younger and less cynical have found themselves entrenched in the Anarchs.

  <ul>
  * <b>Sect:</b> Anarch (Younger), Camarilla (Older)
  * <b>Disciplines:</b>  Auspex, Celerity, Presence
  * <b>Weakness:</b> When a Toreador experiences something truly remarkable — a person, an objet d’art, a lovely sunrise — the player must make a Self-Control or Instincts roll (difficulty 6). Failure means that the Kindred finds herself enthralled by the experience. The dazzled Toreador cannot act for the duration of the scene aside from commenting on or continuing their involvement with whatever has captured their attention. If the experience no longer affects her (whether by moving, being destroyed, or whatever is appropriate to the situation), the captivation ends. Enraptured Toreador may not even defend themselves if attacked, though being wounded allows them to make another Self-Control or Instincts roll.
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b> Toreador ghouls suffer from a tendency to overprotect their masters. Often, Toreador ghouls might perceive a threat where there is none, and lash out believing that the safety of their domitors is at risk. At the Storyteller’s discretion, when a Toreador ghoul leaps to the conclusion that her domitor may be harmed, she must make a Self-Control or Instinct roll. The difficulty is 6.
  </ul>

  #### ** Tremere **

  <div class="secondHeader">Tremere</div>
  <em>"When the world refuses to give, he who makes himself amaster of the world may still take."</em>

  Noble House Tremere is one of the four remaining Pillars of the Camarilla. The blood sorcerers sought to harbor the pregnant kindred within the walls of the chantries in a desire to research the new phenomenon. The Pyramid cracked when the Inner Circle sent out the edict, with former primogen Carna taking it upon herself to forge the Tremere anew beneath the anarch's banner.


  Tremere who have defected to House Carna have their previous bonds to the clan replaced. Through a special ritual created by the elder (which bears rather suspicious resemblance to the Valuderie preformed by the Sabbat), all are to mix their vitae in a chalice with her own and any others present. Drinking of it removes any ties to the Pyramid and destroys any other blood bonds, but ties them to all other participants and, most importantly, Carna herself. Mechanically, the player must roll to see how strong their connection is to her and other chantry members. Unlike a normal vinculum, this will max out at 6 versus 10, so a d6 must be rolled to achieve this score.


  * <b>Sect:</b> Camarilla (Majority), Anarchs (House Carna)
  * <b>Disciplines:</b>  Auspex, Dominate, Thaumaturgy
  * <b>Weakness:</b> Tremere dependency on blood is even more pronounced than that of other Kindred. It takes only two draughts of another vampire’s blood for a Tremere to become blood bound instead of the normal three — the first drink counts as if the Tremere had taken two drinks.
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b> Tremere ghouls are extremely susceptible to the blood bond. Their difficulty to break the blood bond is twice that of other ghouls.


  #### ** Ventrue **

  <div class="secondHeader">Ventrue</div>
  <em>"There is no shame to bending the knee to one such as myself, so pay your fucking tribute before I lose my temper."</em>

  As one of the remaining pillar clans of the Camarilla, the Blue Blooded Kings would seek to maintain their creation - no matter the cost. With a majority of Camarilla Princedoms dominated by Ventrue Princes, many would quickly discover themselves without domains, or embattled on the streets. This menace to their clan caused Hardstadt to return to the fray, taking back the reins of clan leadership. While recently, a new Prince was appointed to Los Angeles, after the previous one abdicated and deserted to the Anarchs - A Camarilla Traditionalist by the name of Nathanial Stafford.

  <ul>
  * <b>Sect:</b> Camarilla
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Dominate, Fortitude, Presence
  * <b>Weakness:</b> The Ventrue have rarified tastes, and they find only one specific type of mortal blood palatable and vital for them. When a player creates a Ventrue character, he should decide with the Storyteller what specific type of blood suits the character, and this choice is permanent. Blood of other types (even animals) simply offers the vampire no blood pool increase, no matter how much he consumes — he simply vomits it back up. This refined palate may be very narrow or very broad — say, the blood of younger sisters, or the blood of nude children. Vampiric blood is exempt from this restriction.
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b> Ventrue ghouls are more susceptible to the commands of their masters. As such, when attempting to resist an order from any Ventrue, their difficulty to resist the use of the Dominate Discipline, or the Intimidation and Leadership Skills, is increased by two.
  </ul>

  #### ** Caitiff **

  <div class="secondHeader">Caitiff</div>
  <em>"So, what will it be, Sheriff? The stake and the sun, or exile?"</em>

  For the Unbound, not much has changed in modern nights. The reversion was just another layer in their existential shit sandwich. However, the recent split within the Tower caused a change in the status of the Orphans. Caitiff within defected cities, along with their Anarch compatriots, were brought back into the fold as their former tormentors and oppressors joined their ranks. The life of a Caitiff is by no means an easy one, but things have gotten just a little bit better for the Clanless. In Los Angeles, it is business as usual for most Caitiff aside from welcoming in the Camarilla and Sabbat defectors as they come.

  <ul>
  * <b>Sect:</b> Anarch
  * <b>Disciplines:</b> Caitiff need to have at least one or two disciplines from the parent clan that spawned them, and then they are able to take the rest from the common disciplines (Animalism, Auspex, Celerity, Dominate, Presence, Potence, Fortitude, and Obfuscate). However, the cost to increase all Disciplines with experience points is six times the current rating, rather than the usual five for in-Clan Disciplines or seven for out-of-Clan Disciplines.
  * <b>Weakness:</b> Until the Caitiff establishes themselves in a domain or social group, they are at +2 Difficulty on all Social rolls with non-Caitiff vampires. When Caitiff Embrace, their childer are also Caitiff.
  * <b>Ghoul Weakness:</b> None
  </ul>

  Attributes

  Prioritize the three categories (Physical, Social, and Mental) for your character. Make sure to keep what each dot means in general in mind when allotting them.

  <b>Vampires:</b> distribute 7/5/3 <br>
  <b>Ghouls & Humans:</b> distribute 6/4/3


  <div class="yourAttentionPlease" style="margin-top: 20px;">

  <b>Important</b>

  * All attributes start with a single dot which <b>aren't</b> counted. The only exception to this are Nosferatu, as their appearance would be 0.
  * Anything at 4 dots or higher should be justified within the character's biography and personality, considering they would have to be using it frequently to be at that level.
  * For any attributes that are at 4 dots or more, make sure to apply a specialty.
  * Specific information on what all of the attributes mean in Vampire can be found <a href="traits.md">here</a>.

  For ease of reference, this is roughly what each of the dot levels mean for attributes. For specific levels at each stage, please see the <a href="traits.md">traits</a> page.

Make sure to think less about what they primarily do but things on the side. If they enjoy being around animals, a dot of animal ken wouldn’t be a stretch. If they sang in their church choir, a dot of performance would make sense. Really think about them as a complete person to spend these realistically instead of just maximizing what they’re “supposed to be good at.”

There are abilities that require you to select specialties early:
* Academics
* Crafts
* Expression
* Law

* Path of Redemption
* Path of Nocturnal Redemption

<b>Important</b>


There should be a clear reason as to why the character is on a path. If you are unable to come up with a reason as to how they were able to switch their morality or why, they should remain on humanity.

* Additional flaws may be taken past the 7 points for flavor only, they do not award further freebie points
* If you are interested in taking a Path of Enlightenment or play a Bloodline, both require "merits" custom to LA in Anarchy at the cost of 3 freebies for a path, and 5 for a Bloodline, in addition to the other requirements.

"In-Clan" Disciplines for ghouls are those of the clan of their first domitor, regardless of the domitor's actual Disciplines. Independent ghouls consider the physical Disciplines (Celerity, Fortitude, Potence) in-clan. Ghouls not currently in a vampire's service are considered Independent.
